// Problem Statement:
// You are given a 2D array queries, where queries[i] is of the form [l, r].
// Each queries[i] defines an array of integers nums consisting of elements ranging from l to r, both inclusive.
// In one operation, you can:
// Select two integers a and b from the array.
// Replace them with floor(a / 4) and floor(b / 4).
// Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce all elements of the array to zero for each query. Return the sum of the results for all queries.

// Approach:
// The problem can be solved by observing how the sum of operations required for each individual number changes with each operation. Let's define `ops(x)` as the number of divisions by 4 needed to reduce a single number `x` to zero. For example, `ops(1)=1`, `ops(4)=2`, `ops(16)=3`. This can be calculated with the recursive relation `ops(x) = 1 + ops(floor(x/4))` for `x > 0`, and `ops(0) = 0`.
// In a single operation, we replace two numbers `a` and `b` with `floor(a/4)` and `floor(b/4)`. The total sum of `ops` values for all numbers in the array changes from `... + ops(a) + ops(b) + ...` to `... + ops(floor(a/4)) + ops(floor(b/4)) + ...`.
// The change in the total sum is `(ops(a) + ops(b)) - (ops(floor(a/4)) + ops(floor(b/4)))`. Since `ops(x) - ops(floor(x/4)) = 1` for `x > 0`, this change is `(1 + ops(floor(a/4))) + (1 + ops(floor(b/4))) - (ops(floor(a/4)) + ops(floor(b/4))) = 2`.
// Each operation reduces the total sum of `ops` values by exactly 2. The final state of the array consists of all zeros, where the sum of `ops` values is 0. Therefore, the total number of operations required is `(sum of ops values for all initial numbers) / 2`.
// To find the sum of `ops` values for all numbers in a range `[l, r]`, we can use a prefix sum approach. We can define a function `F(n)` that calculates `sum_{i=1 to n} ops(i)`. The sum for a range `[l, r]` is then `F(r) - F(l-1)`.
// `F(n)` can be computed efficiently using recursion with memoization. The recurrence relation is derived from `F(n) = sum_{i=1 to n} (1 + ops(floor(i/4))) = n + sum_{i=1 to n} ops(floor(i/4))`. The second term can be broken down: `sum_{i=1 to n} ops(floor(i/4)) = 4 * F(floor(n/4)) - (3 - n%4) * ops(floor(n/4))`.
// Thus, `F(n) = n + 4 * F(floor(n/4)) + (n%4 - 3) * ops(floor(n/4))`.
// We can use two memoization maps, one for `F(n)` and one for `ops(x)`, to avoid re-computation. The number of unique values for `n` and `x` in the recursive calls is logarithmic, making this approach very efficient.

// Time Complexity:
// For each query, `F(r)` and `F(l-1)` are computed. The number of unique arguments for the `F` and `ops` functions is logarithmic with respect to the input values `r` and `l`. With memoization, each call to `F` or `ops` with a new value takes `O(log(n))` time for the recursive calls, but each unique value is computed only once. Across all queries, the total number of unique arguments is proportional to `queries.length * log(max_r)`. Thus, the time complexity is `O(Q * log(max_R))` where `Q` is the number of queries and `R` is the maximum value of `r`.

// Space Complexity:
// The space is dominated by the memoization maps. The number of unique keys in the maps is `O(Q * log(max_R))`, so the space complexity is `O(Q * log(max_R))`.
