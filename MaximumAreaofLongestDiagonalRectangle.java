// For this problem, we need to find the maximum area of a rectangle with the longest diagonal. If there's a tie in diagonal length, we return the maximum area among those rectangles.

// Approach
// First, we'll iterate through each rectangle's dimensions in the dimensions array. For each rectangle, we'll calculate the square of its diagonal length and its area. We're using the square of the diagonal length to avoid using sqrt, as comparing d1^2 and d2^2 is equivalent to comparing d1 and d2 for positive numbers, and it's computationally faster. The formula for the diagonal of a rectangle is d=
// sqrtl^2+w^2 , so d^2  =l^2 +w^2.
// The area is simply $l \* w$.

// We'll maintain two variables: maxDiagonalSquared to track the maximum squared diagonal length found so far, and maxArea to track the corresponding maximum area.

// As we iterate:

// 1 .For the current rectangle with length l and width w, calculate currentDiagonalSquared and currentArea.

// 2 .Compare currentDiagonalSquared with maxDiagonalSquared:

// If currentDiagonalSquared is greater than maxDiagonalSquared, we have found a new longest diagonal. We update maxDiagonalSquared to currentDiagonalSquared and maxArea to currentArea.

// If currentDiagonalSquared is equal to maxDiagonalSquared, we're in a tie-breaker situation. We compare currentArea with maxArea. If currentArea is greater, we update maxArea to currentArea while maxDiagonalSquared remains unchanged.

// 3. We continue this process for all rectangles.

// 4 . After the loop, maxArea will hold the correct value to be returned.


// Complexity Analysis
// Time Complexity: The solution involves a single pass through the dimensions array. If N is the number of rectangles, the time complexity is O(N).

// Space Complexity: We are using a few variables to store the maximum values, which is constant space. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
