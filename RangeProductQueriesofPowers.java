// Problem Statement:
// Given a positive integer n, there exists a 0-indexed array called powers, composed of the minimum number of powers of 2 that sum to n. The array is sorted in non-decreasing order, and there is only one way to form the array.
// You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array queries, where queries[i] = [left_i, right_i]. Each queries[i] represents a query where you have to find the product of all powers[j] with left_i <= j <= right_i.
// Return an array answers, equal in length to queries, where answers[i] is the answer to the ith query. Since the answer to the ith query may be too large, each answers[i] should be returned modulo 10^9 + 7.

// Approach:
// 1. First, we need to find the powers of 2 that sum up to n. This is equivalent to finding the set bits in the binary representation of n. The powers array will contain 2^i for each bit i that is set in n. We can iterate from 0 up to 30 (since n <= 10^9, which is less than 2^30) and check if the i-th bit of n is set. If it is, we add 2^i to our powers list.
// 2. To efficiently handle the product queries, we can use a prefix product array. The prefix product at index i will store the product of all powers from index 0 to i, modulo 10^9 + 7.
// 3. Let's call this prefix product array `prefixProducts`. `prefixProducts[i] = powers[0] * powers[1] * ... * powers[i] % MOD`.
// 4. For each query `[left, right]`, the product of `powers[left]` to `powers[right]` can be calculated as `(prefixProducts[right] * modInverse(prefixProducts[left - 1])) % MOD`.
// 5. If `left` is 0, the product is simply `prefixProducts[right]`.
// 6. The modular inverse of a number `a` modulo `m` can be calculated using Fermat's Little Theorem since `m = 10^9 + 7` is a prime number. The modular inverse of `a` is `a^(m-2) % m`.
// 7. We can implement a function for modular exponentiation to calculate `a^(m-2) % m` efficiently.
// 8. We then iterate through the queries, calculate the product for each query using the prefix product array and modular inverse, and store the result in our answers array.

// Time Complexity:
// O(log n + q*log(MOD))
// - Building the powers array: O(log n) since we iterate up to log n (or 30).
// - Building the prefix products array: O(log n).
// - For each query: O(log(MOD)) to calculate the modular inverse using modular exponentiation.
// - q is the number of queries.

// Space Complexity:
// O(log n)
// - The `powers` array will have at most log n elements.
// - The `prefixProducts` array will also have at most log n elements.
